# My Learning Notes

> I am a software developer working in Singapore Changi Airport. As you can tell from the company name, firstly, it is not a startup in Silicon Valley. Secondly, it is not a software/tech company. However, that doesn't mean working as a software developer is not challenging in Singapore Changi Airport.
> 
> Software developers in the company are expected to always be creative to provide software/hardware solutions for the business needs. As a team, we work on projects in different areas, such as mobile-first web app development, mobile app development, and cloud-based vending machines IoT projects.
> 
> Hence, in order to keep up with the fast-paced changes, I need to learn a lot of technologies. So, I have this repository to share what I've learned to my teammates so we can learn together!

## My Learning Journey

 - [ASP .NET MVC](/aspnet/mvc)
 - Microsoft Azure
 - Visual Studio
 - UI/UX
 - SCSS
 - Windows 10 IoT
 - ASP .NET Core
 - Django and Python
 - NodeJS with MEAN Stack
 - AngularJS
 - ReactJS
 - Readings and Books
 
## Why?
I actually have a blog at [https://cuteprogramming.wordpress.com](https://cuteprogramming.wordpress.com) sharing about my learning experience and personal hobby projects. However it's not detailed enough. Hence, insprired by [ZuzooVn's Top-down learning path: Machine Learning for Software Engineers](https://github.com/ZuzooVn/machine-learning-for-software-engineers), I decided to keep my detailed learning notes in this Github repository instead while my blog will only give overview about what I've learned.

## What is Singapore Changi Airport?
Singapore Changi Airport is the international airport in Singapore, the smallest country in Southeast Asia. It has been one of the top 3 airports worldwide for 16 consecutive years (2000–2016)!

There is a nice short video clip about Changi Airport attached below.

Anyway, yup, it's not a software company. =)
