# Machine Learning

## What is Machine Learning?
Machine Learning examines **large amount of data** looking for **patterns**, then generates code that lets us **recognize those patterns** in **new data**. Our applications can use the generated code to make better predictions.

Machine Learning applies **statistical techniques** to large amount of data, **looking for the best pattern** to solve our problem. The generated code is referred to as a **Model**, and it can be called by applications that need to solve the problem.

Because Machine Learning helps predict the future, it is often included in the broader category of **Predictive Analytics**.
